- Machine Learning
  * [3rd position in INFORMS national analytics challenge:](https://www.ideaconnection.com/principal-orms-challenge/winners.php) Developed a trading strategy to eliminate human bias in decision making after an extreme effect

- Optimization
  * [Optimum lot sizing problem:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/LP-using-CPLEX) The optimum lot sizing problem under both fixed capacity and varying capacity is formulated using linear and binary integer programming and solved using AMPL CPLEX 
  
  * [Optimizing capacitated vehicle routing problem:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem) A mathematical model to find out optimal route for delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods. A mixed-integer-program (MIP) formulated and solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX and Python 3
  
  * [Maximum Independent Set (MIS) exact algorithm implementation:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/maximum_independent_set-MIS-) An independent set or stable set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. Finding maximum independent set (MIS) is a hard problem. Implemented 2 exact algorithms to find MIS on 10 networks with < 500 nodes from the 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge
