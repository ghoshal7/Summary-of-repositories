# Contents
- Machine Learning
  * [3rd position in INFORMS national analytics challenge:](https://www.ideaconnection.com/principal-orms-challenge/winners.php) Developed a trading strategy to eliminate human bias in decision making after an extreme effect
  * [Predicting wind power output:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Wind-Power-Prediction) Feature engineered environmental parameters and created a hybrid model using support vector machine (SVM) regression and extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) to predict the wind power output with 3.2% RMSE on validation set using 10 fold cross-validation
  * [Auto identifying fake news from real ones:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Fake_or_real_news) Digitized text data and implemented various machine learning algorithm to predict fake news and compared the results of the algorithms with each other

- Deep Learning and Neural Networks:
  * [Natural language processing with recurrent neural network (RNN):](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Toxic_comment-Classification-with-RNN) Digitized over 150,000 texts, extracted features and implemented long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) with accuracy of 98.5% on training and 97.27% on validation 
  * <b> Object detection for self-driving cars with Neural Network:</b> Implemented pretrained Keras YOLO (‘yolo.h5’) algorithm with 5 anchor boxes to detect objects using IOU and non-max supression 

- Time Series prediction
  * [Time series analysis of stock price of ExxonMobil](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Econometric-Time-Series-Analysis-of-stock-price) •	Conducted single and multi-variate time series analysis of stock prices using P/ACF and ARIMA, SARIMA, ARMA and VAR methods, regressed stock price on econometric parameters & developed final predictive model to generate short-time predictions on the test set

- Optimization
  * [Optimum lot sizing problem:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/LP-using-CPLEX) The optimum lot sizing problem under both fixed capacity and varying capacity is formulated using linear and binary integer programming and solved using AMPL CPLEX 
  
  * [Optimizing capacitated vehicle routing problem:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem) A mathematical model to find out optimal route for delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods. A mixed-integer-program (MIP) formulated and solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX and Python 3
  
  * [Maximum Independent Set (MIS) exact algorithm implementation:](https://github.com/ghoshal7/maximum_independent_set-MIS-) An independent set or stable set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. Finding maximum independent set (MIS) is a hard problem. Implemented 2 exact algorithms to find MIS on 10 networks with < 500 nodes from the 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge
